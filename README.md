# Generating_DeepFakes_Using_DCGan

Library/Frameworks used :-
  Keras
  Tensorflow 2.1.0
  
Input size :-
 28 x 28 x 1 Images, this can be modified by changing the input size in the generator and discriminator models.
 
Instruction to execute the project :-
        1) Download DCGan.ipynb
        2) Upload the code file in google colab or jupyter notebook
        3) Click Runtime -> Change Runtime type -> select gpu -> save
        4) Click Runtime -> Run all
        
        For faster results, we need to change the runtime type of colab from cpu to gpu.
        Otherwise step 3 is optional.
        Instructions :-
        1) Download DCGan.ipynb
        2) Upload the code file in google colab or jupyter notebook
        3) Click Runtime -> Run all
        
By default, we have used MNIST dataset, it can be modified and any dataset can be used.
